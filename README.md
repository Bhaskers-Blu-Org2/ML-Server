# Microsoft Machine Learning Server Samples and Solutions

**Microsoft Machine Learning Server** supports R and Python deployments on Windows, Linux and Hadoop. See the [Machine Learning server documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/machine-learning-server/install/r-server-install-supported-platforms) for more information about supported platforms.

Microsoft Machine Learning Services brings the compute to the data by allowing R or Python to run on the same computer as the database. It includes the Trusted Launchpad service, which runs outside the SQL Server process and communicates securely with the R or Python runtime.

Use the MSDN Forum [Microsoft Machine Learning Server]( https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=MicrosoftR) for questions about ML Server. If you have questions about the samples and solutions, please open an issue in the relevant repository.

This repository serves as a landing page for you to more easily find the samples and solutions in other repositories. Please create a pull request if you have a repository you'd like to add to this list.
